Review
better than any you can get at a restaurant!
"I cut back on the mayo, and made up the difference with sour cream to adjust the stiffness of the dip."
i think i did something wrong because i could taste the cornstarch in the finished product.
"easily the best i have ever had.  juicy flavorful, not dry.  the vegetables retain crispness as well, not bland at all!"
An excellent dish.
"love it, but without the bean sprouts."
"chewy goodness, not crispy at all. i even threw in craisins and left the oatmeal whole, and they were great."
Would someone please check the Nutrition Facts of this recipe.
thought this was terrific!
this is absolutely delicious.  i even served it with lime slices so you could squeeze on more of the acid.
