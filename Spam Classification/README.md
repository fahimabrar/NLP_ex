# Spam Classification

## Machine Learning Based Models
Used Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression Algorithms
- Text preprocessing
- Used TFIDF vectorization
- Used Five Fold Cross Validations
- Hyperparameter Tuning
Highst accuracy obtained by SVM classifier that is 98.52 percent


## Deep Learning Based Models
Used 1D CNN, GRU, LSTM inside the model
- Used tokenization, padding, keras embeddings for embedding the words
- used binary crossentropy as loss function and Adam as optimizer
- Train with only five ephochs 
- Highest accuracy obtained is 98.95 percent

## Transformer Based Models
